    <h2>Twilight Struggle: Quickplay Instructions</h2>

    <p></p>

1. PLACE STARTING INFLUENCE

    <p></p>
 
Twilight Struggle starts with the US and the USSR putting their starting influence on the board. If you are new to the game, a good start for the Soviets is 4 influence in East Germany, 4 influence in Poland and 1 influence in Yugoslavia. If you are playing as the United States a good starting position is 4 influence in West Germany and 3 influence in Italy.

    <p></p>
 
2. PICK HEADLINE CARD

    <p></p>

Both players pick a headline card. The event on this card will happen before the start of the round. The event with the highest number goes first, except in the event of a tie in which case the US event happens first.

    <p></p>

3. PLAY ROUNDS:

    <p></p>

The USSR and US now take turns picking cards and playing them. All turns give players the following choices:

    <p></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	Play Event:
      	<p></p>
	The event on the card happens.
      </li>
      <li>
	Play Operation Points (OPS)
	<p></p>
	You get to use the points on the card to do one of three things.
	<p></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Place Influence
	    <p></p>
	    Add influence to a country in which you have influence or any country adjacent to it. New players should focus on getting Battleground Countries ("purple countries") first. Once you have enough influence in the country you will gain "control" and it will cost your opponent 2 operation points to place 1 influence.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Coup
	    <p></p>
	    If successful, a coup reduces the amount of influence your opponent has in a country and/or adds influence for you. You can only coup countries in which your opponent has influence, and as DEFCON lowers certain regions of the board are off-limits for coups. If you coup a Battleground Country ("purple country") DEFCON will fall by one point. If DEFCON ever hits 1 the player whose turn it is loses the game.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Realignment
	    <p></p>
	    Roll the dice and remove influence from one player. Controlling surrounding countries and having more influence than your opponent in the target country increases your chance of winning.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>

    IMPORTANT NOTES:

    <ul>
      <li>
    If you play a card belonging to your opponent the event WILL happen regardless. You can choose whether it happens before or after you play your operations points.
      </li>
      <li>
    If you have a Scoring Card, you MUST play it during your turn.
      </li>
      <li>
    Discard cards you do not wish to play on the Space Race
      </li>
