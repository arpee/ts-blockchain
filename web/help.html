    <h2>Twilight Struggle: Quickplay Instructions</h2>

    <p></p>

1. PLACE STARTING INFLUENCE

    <p></p>

A good start for the Soviets is East Germany (4), Poland (4) and Yugoslavia (1). A good start for the Americans is West Germany (4) and Italy (3).

    <p></p>
 
2. PICK HEADLINE CARD

    <p></p>

The event will happen before the start of the round. The highest card number goes first, with the US event happening first in case of ties.

    <p></p>

3. PLAY ROUNDS:

    <p></p>

The USSR and US take turns picking cards and playing them. All cards may be played as follows:

    <p></p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	Play Event:
      	<p></p>
	The event on the card happens.
        <p></p>
      </li>
      <li>
	Play Operation Points (OPS)
	<p></p>
	You can use the points on the card as follows:
	<p></p>
	<ol>
	  <li>
	    Place Influence
	    <p></p>
	    Add influence to a country in which you have influence or any country adjacent to it.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Coup
	    <p></p>
	    You can only coup a country in which your opponent has influence. As DEFCON lowers certain regions of the board become off-limits for coups. Couping in a Battleground Country lowers DEFCON by one point. The "power" of the coup is the total points on the card you play added to a roll of the dice minus twice the stability of the country (the number in the top-right of each country box).
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Realignment
	    <p></p>
	    Roll the dice and remove influence from one player. Controlling surrounding countries and having more influence than your opponent in the target country increases your chance of winning.
	    <p></p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	Space Race:
      	<p></p>
	You may discard one card per turn on the Space Race, OPS permitting. If you are lucky, you will advance one in the Space Race track.
        <p></p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p></p>

    IMPORTANT NOTES:

    <ul>
      <li>
    If you play a card belonging to your opponent the event WILL happen regardless. You can choose whether it happens before or after you play your operations points.
      </li>
      <li>
    If you have a Scoring Card, you MUST play it during your turn.
      </li>
      <li>
    Discard cards you do not wish to play on the Space Race
      </li>
